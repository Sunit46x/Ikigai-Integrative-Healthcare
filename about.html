        <section class="our-story">
            <h2>Our story</h2>
            <p>
                At Ikigai Integrative Healthcare, we believe that healing isn’t a destination, it’s a rhythm your body
                remembers.
                Founded by Dr. Priyanka Gavhane (Anurati), a trained Ayurvedic physician and integrative health
                consultant, Ikigai was born from a simple yet powerful question:
                What if medicine treated the person, not just the symptom?
            </p>

            <p>
                After years of working in conventional clinics, Dr. Anurati realized that something critical was
                missing, a structured, daily, root-cause approach that could bridge
                ancient Ayurvedic wisdom with the precision of modern diagnostics. Hormonal imbalances, metabolic
                disorders, chronic fatigue, these conditions weren’t just biological events;
                they were disruptions in rhythm, nourishment, and clarity.<br>
                That’s where Ikigai began.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ikigai means <strong>“a reason for being.”</strong> And for us, that means walking with each client
                through every phase of healing,
                using Ayurvedic tools like prakriti, agni, ojas alongside hormone mapping, micronutrient profiling,
                gut-brain regulation, and meal-by-meal support.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, Ikigai is more than a clinic. It’s a lifestyle lab. A place where PCOS isn’t just managed, it’s
                reversed. Where postnatal bodies are understood, not judged.
                Where real food becomes medicine, not through trends, but through tradition and science.<br>
                Our story is not just about medicine. It’s about restoring rhythm. And we’re just getting started.

                        nutritional gaps, circadian misalignment and build protocols that reverse them from the inside
